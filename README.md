Stock Price Prediction Project

Introduction
The problem statement for this project is to develop a stock price prediction model using machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data and other relevant factors.

*Why Stock Price Prediction is Important*
Stock price prediction is essential for several reasons:

1. **Investment Decision Making**: Investors use stock price predictions to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. Accurate predictions can help maximize returns and minimize losses.

2. **Risk Management**: Accurate stock price predictions can assist in managing risk associated with investments. Understanding potential price movements allows investors to take appropriate hedging or risk-reducing actions.

3. **Portfolio Optimization**: Stock price predictions are vital for building a diversified and well-balanced investment portfolio. Investors can adjust their portfolio based on predicted price trends.

4. **Financial Planning**: Individuals and organizations use stock price predictions for financial planning. These predictions are essential for retirement planning, budgeting, and long-term financial strategies.

5. **Market Analysis**: Stock price predictions are used by analysts and financial institutions for market analysis and research reports. Understanding market trends can have a broad impact on the financial industry.

*Metrics*: RMSE and MSE
In stock price prediction, we commonly use two metrics to assess model performance:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual stock prices. A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual prices. However, MSE is not very intuitive, as it's in squared units.

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It provides a measure of the average prediction error in the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret. Lower RMSE values suggest more accurate predictions.

*Data*
We used the "msft" dataset in CSV format. Data preprocessing steps included removing null values and filling in missing data. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle if needed.

*Methodology*
Our approach involved explaining RMSE and MSE algorithms regarding stock price prediction and outlining the steps involved in data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

*Dependencies*
The project required the following Python libraries: pandas and numpy.

*Setup*
You can run this project on platforms like Colab or Jupyter.

*Usage*
Simply copy and paste the provided code snippets from the "Usage" section into your preferred Python compiler. It will produce the desired output.

*Results*
We have included screenshots of the output in the documentation section of Phase 5 so that users can view the results.
